# Car App
This app is paradise for car lovers. Share photos, host car meet events, and truly connect with other people and share your love of cars.

This marketplace has huge potential: the main competitor, instagram, is a generalized solution to a very specific niche. Just look at the luxury car and sports car industry. Cars bring like-minded people together in a way we've never seen before.

This was a small project I worked on in First Year of university. Due to time constraints, I was never able to fully launch the app on the marketplace, though I may revive it sometime in the future.

Both the Node.JS server and React Native source code is all here. This is written without the need of BaaS services like Firebase or DynamoDB. So it's fully functional, out of the box.

The Node backend uses state-of-the-art cryptography for passwords on a No-SQL database, namely MongoDB.

Just to clarify, the app is a WIP. Many features have yet to be implemented.

Take a look!
